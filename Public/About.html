    <h1>It All Started When...</h1>
    <p>When Founder,
        Fatinah Hayat, made a decision to take a career break from the fashion industry and headed off to Bali. Whilst in Bali, she discovered that she had a deep love of learning about crafts such as batik and jewellery making. She also loved spending time with people and learning about their lives and culture. From a love of people and handmade products, The Hayat was born.
        
        Hayat, in Arabic, means life. The Hayat is all about bringing people together and celebrating our differences. We offer our customers beautiful, unique products which have a story behind them.
        
        Our aim is to work with artisans, showcasing how the products are made, who has made the products and to work with each community to learn from them whilst giving back.</p>
